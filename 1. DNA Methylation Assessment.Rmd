### Question 1:

Install the version of Bioconductor 
```{r}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install()
```


### Question 3:

Download and install the human genome package BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19. Define the following sequence:

```{r}
BiocManager::install("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
chr22 = Hsapiens[["chr22"]]
s = subseq(chr22,start=23456789,width=1000)
print( as.character(s) )
```

What is the GC-content of s (give answer as a proportion)

```{r}
sum( alphabetFrequency(s)[c("C","G")] ) / 1000
# or
letterFrequency(s, "CG", as.prob=TRUE)
```


### Question 4:

How many CpGs in `s` (as defined in the previous question)

```{r}
countPattern("CG",s)
```

### Question 5:

How many GpCs (G followed by C) in `s` (as defined in the previous question)

```{r}
countPattern("GC",s)
```
